# Fsort
## The First Web-Based Folder Organizer

### **Project Overview**

Fsort is a web-based folder organizer designed to help users intuitively manage files on their local devices.  

Using the [File System Access API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File_System_Access_API), it enables powerful file operations such as bulk renaming, reorganizing into subfolders, and applying user-defined rules based on file metadata like:
- Creation or modification date.
- Name patterns (e.g., contains, starts with, ends with).
- File extensions or types.

---

- **Goals for the Project**:
  - Learn and integrate modern web tools: React, TypeScript, and Vite.
  - Explore the File System Access API for local file management.
  - Create an intuitive UI for advanced file operations (bulk rename, organize by metadata).

- **Planned Features**:
  - Folder picker to select local directories.
  - Filters to organize files based on metadata (e.g., date created).
  - Bulk file operations like renaming and moving.

- **Challenges**:
  - Designing a user-friendly interface for complex operations.
  - Navigating potential issues that may arise from using a relatively new and evolving tool like the File System Access API.

Today, I embarked on this amazing project.

The first thing I did, after coming up with the idea, was consult ChatGPT for tips on how to go about it.

Then, I brainstormed ideas for the name until I came up with **"Fsort"** (i.e., Folder-sort / File-sort). This name is simple, fits well with the nature of the project, and, as a bonus, the domain **fsort.me** was available for free (thanks to the GitHub Student Developer Pack).

Finally, I created the logo:

Today, my school holidays started, so I’ll be able to dedicate more time to this project.

In terms of progress, I added a header to the webpage featuring the logo and project name. Below it, I included a "Choose Folder" button using MUI. The button is just a placeholder for now and doesn’t have functionality yet. I also updated the webpage to include a favicon (logo) and title in the browser tab.

For the design, I chose a dark theme with a color palette inspired by GitHub, which I feel complements the functionality-focused nature of this project.
